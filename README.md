# BetterCallPaul - Programming Challenge

This repository contains my solution for the programming challenge provided by BetterCallPaul.

## üß† Challenge Description

The goal of the challenge is to implement a Java application that:

1. **Weather Task**
   - Reads the `weather.csv` file
   - Finds the **day with the smallest temperature spread** (difference between max and min temperature)

2. **Countries Task**
   - Reads the `countries.csv` file
   - Computes the **population density** for each EU country
   - Returns the country with the **highest population density**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Java 11+
- Maven
- JUnit 5 (for unit testing)
- [OpenCSV](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) (for parsing CSV files)
